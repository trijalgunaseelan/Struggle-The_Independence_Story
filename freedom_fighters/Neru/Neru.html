                Jawaharlal Nehru was born on 14 November 1889. Nehru was the first prime minister of India. He was one of the active Indian freedom fighters in India.

On 19th December 1929 in Lahore, along with Bose, Nehru brought forth the Complete independence declaration which is also known as Purna Swaraj declaration. Through the Indian National Congress, he represented India in 1927. It was the result of the work to internationalise the Indian struggle. 

This became the reason behind the creation of sympathy for the Indian National Movement. A significant role of steering the constituent assembly for Republicanism was played by Jawaharlal Nehru. During the freedom struggle, he was imprisoned for nine times which was about 3259 days. As he loves children, we celebrate his birthday as children's day.
