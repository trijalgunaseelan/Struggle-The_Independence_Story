                Bhagat Singh was born on 28 September 1907 Banga, Punjab, British India(present-day Punjab, Pakistan). He was one of the bravest freedom fighters in the revolutionaries of the Indian independence movement. His patriotism was towards the restriction against British rule and also towards the division of India. 

                Bhagat Singh had an attraction to socialism. He took part in the moon cooperation movement. During his last period of life, he insisted British shoot him instead of hanging him but they didn't consider it. He mentioned this in his last letter and also he mentioned that as he was arrested at the time of war, he cannot be punished and so let him be thrown into the mouth of the cannon. 

                Here the evidence shows how brave he is. The slogan of India's war struggle was coined by him.
