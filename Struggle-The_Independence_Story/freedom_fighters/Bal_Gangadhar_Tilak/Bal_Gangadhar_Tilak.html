                Bal Gangadhar Tilak was born on 23rd July 1856 in Ratnagiri, Maharashtra. British colonial rulers called him the father of the Indian unrest. In 1890, he became a part of the Indian National Congress. He vocalized his opposition to the moderate views of the self-rule. He stopped the Boycott of British goods and the Swadeshi movement. 

                Bal Gangadhar Tilak published two newspapers (Mahratta and Kesari) which focus on the nationalistic aims. This created awareness among the Indians and these propagated the cause of National freedom. In the Gandhian era, he was one of the tallest of the leaders who motivated the nation for the trial and triumphs. 

              Though he contributed much, he and his contribution weren't recognised which he actually deserved.
