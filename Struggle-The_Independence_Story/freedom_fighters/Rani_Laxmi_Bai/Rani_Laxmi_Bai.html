                Rani of Jhansi was born on 19 November 1828 in Benares, Kingdom of Kashi-Benares (present-day Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India). She was attacked and demanded surrender during the rebellion of British forces. 

                Rani of Jhansi declined and joined the forces of Indian rebels. She escaped during the surge of Jhansi with her son.  She joined with the leaders of the rebellion in 1957.  One British officer wrote that Rani of Jhansi was the most dangerous of all Indian leaders and also he mentioned that she was personable, clever and beautiful. 
                
                She played one of the crucial Indian freedom fighters whose pay is considered to be one of the most important parts.
