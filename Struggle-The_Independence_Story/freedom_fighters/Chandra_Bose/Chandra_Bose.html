                He had differences with Gandhi and he wasn't keen on violence as a tool for independence. As a nationalist activist, he went to prison in Mandalay in 1925. After that, he was the INC s general secretary. He worked tirelessly in The Indian National Army, Azad Hind Government, Mass mobilisation, Women mobilisation, Youth leadership. 
                
                One of his beliefs was only through the efforts of the younger generation, India liberation can be achieved. He worked and put efforts with them and he was convinced that they were restless and open to powerful ideas. The invaluable contribution of Indian freedom fighters needed to be remembered with each of the countries in the world.
