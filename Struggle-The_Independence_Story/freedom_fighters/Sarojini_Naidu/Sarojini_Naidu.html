                Sarojini Chattopadhyay was born on 13 February 1879 in Hyderabad, Hyderabad State, British India (now in Telangana, India). One of the famous Indian freedom fighters, Sarojini Naidu played a pivotal role. She was the Crusader of equality and the port of modern India. 

                The first Indian woman President of the Congress, Sarojini Naidu, left a lasting impression on women in India. The nightingale of India became a focal point on the women's right struggle in India. With Annie Besant and others, she did favour in shaping women's Indian association in 1917. 
                
                Here the association sought equal rights for both female and male.  She delivered the requirement to include more women in the struggle of freedom. Each and every step of the Indian freedom fighters are much important as they're the only step which is the reason behind the experience of freedom by us.
