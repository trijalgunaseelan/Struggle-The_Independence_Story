                Mangal Pandey was born on 19 July 1827 in Nagwa, Ballia district, Ceded and Conquered Provinces, Company India. One of the notable contributions was given by him. He was remembered as he strongly stood against the British and he was the one who was sparking the Indian rebellion of 1857.

                His struggle for freedom inspires us a lot. Many Indians during that time were inspired by his rebellion which became the reason for the voice against the rule of British rule. And this later became the major revolution.
