                Chandra Shekhar Azad was born on 23 July 1906 in Bhavra, Central India Agency, British India. He actively participated in the Kakori train robbery in 1925, the revenge killing of a British police officer in 1928 and several other revolutionary activities. 

                He was especially known for his organizing skills. He is the one who reorganised the HSRA. He is also the one who dreamt and wished for the complete independence of India. He was determined not to be captured by police as after the death of Lala Lajpat Rai he killed the British assistant superintendent of police. 

              At Allahabad's Alfred Park, he arranged to meet a revolutionary on 27 February 1931. But the police surrounded him as soon as he got into the park. He thought with them but as he found no way to escape from them, he shot himself. Though he lived only for 25 years, his role was one of the unforgettable and important parts of the freedom of India.
